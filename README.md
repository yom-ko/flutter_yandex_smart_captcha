To learn more about Yandex SmartCaptcha, visit its [official page](https://yandex.cloud/en/services/smartcaptcha).

This package was inspired by [flutter_yandex_smartcaptcha](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_yandex_smartcaptcha), but it offers several improvements, including bug fixes, slightly better performance, enhanced documentation, and a cleaner API.
