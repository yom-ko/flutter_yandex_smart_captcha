This package makes it easy to integrate Yandex SmartCaptcha into Flutter mobile apps. To learn more about the Yandex SmartCaptcha service, visit its [official page](https://yandex.cloud/en/services/smartcaptcha).

This package was inspired by [flutter_yandex_smartcaptcha](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_yandex_smartcaptcha), but it offers several improvements, including bug fixes, slightly better performance, enhanced documentation, and a much [cleaner API](https://pub.dev/documentation/yandex_smart_captcha/latest/yandex_smart_captcha).

## Motivation

One day at work, I urgently needed to integrate a Yandex CAPTCHA into a mobile app, and the `flutter_yandex_smartcaptcha` package came to the rescue. However, I discovered a serious bug and reported it to the author. When they didn’t respond, I decided to create a similar package myself and learn how to publish packages on pub.dev in the process. The end of the magnificent story.


## Usage

Super simple! Here’s the most basic example:

```dart
YandexSmartCaptcha(
  config: CaptchaConfig(
    clientKey: 'your-client-key',
  ),
  onChallengeSolved: (token) {
    // Handle the solved captcha token
  },
)
```

In most cases, you’ll only need the `YandexSmartCaptcha` and `CaptchaConfig` classes. The `CaptchaController` is entirely optional – it's useful if you need to trigger a challenge popup programmatically, but that’s rare.

#### Configuration parameters
| Parameter | Required | Default | Description |
|:----------|:-----------:|:-----------:|-------------|
| `clientKey` | ✔ |  | The client-side key passed to the Web SmartCaptcha. |
| `alwaysShowChallenge` |  | `false` | If `true`, the user will always see a challenge. |
| `language` |  | `ru` | The language for the Web SmartCaptcha UI. |
| `invisibleMode` |  | `false` | If `true`, the CAPTCHA runs in invisible mode – without the "I’m not a robot" checkbox. |
| `hideDPNBadge` |  | `false` | If `true` and `invisibleMode` is enabled, the badge linking to the Data Processing Notice (DPN) will be hidden. |
| `dpnBadgePosition` |  | `bottomRight` | If `invisibleMode` is enabled, this option specifies the position of the DPN badge. |
| `webViewMode` |  | `true` | If `true`, the CAPTCHA runs in a special WebView mode, improving challenge accuracy on mobile devices. |
| `initialContentScale` |  | `1.0` | The initial scale factor for the Web SmartCaptcha content. |
| `userScalableContent` |  | `false` | If `true`, the user can zoom in and out of the Web SmartCaptcha content. |
| `maximumContentScale` |  | `3.0` | If `userScalableContent` is enabled, this defines the maximum scale factor for the content. |
| `backgroundColor` |  | `null` | The background color of the `YandexSmartCaptcha` widget. |

> ✱ "Web SmartCaptcha" refers to the underlying HTML document, hosted in a WebView, that runs the Yandex SmartCaptcha JavaScript code.
